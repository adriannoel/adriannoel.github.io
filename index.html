		<p> <h4>About</h4> : I'm a batch '14 BS Computer Science Student. I'm artistic in "some" sense (currently trying to practice sketching and watercolor painting again) and also a casual gamer. </p>
		<p> Reason for taking ComSci: It was actually my 2nd choice (1st choice being Chemical Eng.). I was planning on shifting but I kinda liked what I was learning so I pushed through with Com. Sci.</p>
		<p> Favorite ComSci Subject: CMSC 150, I clutched my extremely failing grade(due to the 1st exam) to a 65% at the end of the sem.</p>
		<p> Favorite Programming Language: Java, since I've been regularly using it now (though I still need to check the api now and then). </p>
		<p> Hobbies: Sketching, Painting(watercolor for now), Gaming, Studying Japanese</p>
		<p> Favorite Food: Dimsum or Dumplings</p>
		<p> Favorite Color: Red/Black Combo </p>
